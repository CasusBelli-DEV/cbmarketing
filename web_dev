Here we will set up our website. Or to be more exactly, the little "framework" we want to build at the same time in the development process.  Everything here after creating the public business site is just for testing because we will be using our own public website as a visitable test environment. Our goal, among others, is to create a beautiful library with individual elements for websites that can be used across platforms, devices and cms systems. Of course not too difficult today. But our focus on clean, good and not already seen all around design is shown. Please do not hesitate to use everything you see here. But also at your own risk ...

And please ... this will be my personal (but public) test and development environment. I do what I want, how I want, with whom I want and far from learned workarounds or other "rules". So if you are a highly professional full stack heititaiti developer who does take care of all of these things. Please see this here as a fun kindergarten full of crazy, maniac kids on amphetamine and with computers. Just look at us with a wise smile and let's play. Because indeed .. you and your rules and your opinion. This is Casus Belli Marketing ... and we don't fckn care ... !!!!
